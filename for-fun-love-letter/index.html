            <h2>Dear Beloved MDN, <small>how do you do?</small></h2>
            <p>I hope this letter finds you in the best of health alongside your beloved Mozilla family. Forgive me for taking too long of a time to write you this letter, but I was quite busy with matters pertaining to my family. My parents held a housewarming event at our new house and it was wonderful albeit exhausting, but I digress.</p>

            <p>I hope our time away has not make you forget me. As they say,</p>

            <p>Our time was brief but <strong>magical</strong>. And everyday hurts without you by my side.</p>

            <p>If I could, I would (and I should) recreate the potrait that I painted of you during our time together.</p>

            <p>The quality's fantastic if I say so myself. Of course, your beauty enabled this rendition of mine to happen. I am merely a conduit of your Aphroditic magnificence to the world.</p>

            <p>Everyday I prayed to the Almighty for His Blessings and He showered me with His Encompassing Love: in the form of you.</p>

            <p>For the time being, this portrait will do until we meet again.</p>

            <b>My friends say that I am brilliant.</b>

            <p>But nothing could be further than the truth for I am merely the face and you are the brain.</p>

            <p>I still remember when you taught me about the <a href="#element-dfn">elements</a>. My favourite one was and is always you. But if a <em><strong>preposterous</strong></em> hypothetical would be imposed upon myself to pick another one, I would not dare to think of it.</p>
            
            <p>But there is something to be said about <code>&lt;kbd&gt;&lt;/kbd&gt;</code>. When the browser renders <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, I feel myself losing control.</p>

            <p>Forgive me, my love. I've letten go of my emotions there for a bit. Excuse me while I commit the Japanese seppuku for my betrayal.</p>
            
            <p>My devotion is entirely yours.</p>

            <b>Before I go...</b>

            <p>Please keep this photograph as a memento of our time together. You look beautiful.</p>
